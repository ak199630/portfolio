  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism / Swiss Style Fusion**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **High Contrast & Clarity**: Prioritize readability and bold statements over subtle nuances.
  2.  **Grid-Based Precision**: Use a visible or strongly implied grid to organize the dense information (metrics, timelines).
  3.  **Raw & Honest**: Show the "structure" of the content, using borders and lines to separate sections clearly.
  4.  **Function over Form**: Every element has a purpose; decoration is minimal and geometric.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Indigo (#4f46e5)**: Used as a high-voltage accent for buttons, links, and key metrics to draw the eye immediately.
  *   **Slate/Gray**: Deep, dark grays for text to ensure maximum contrast against a stark white background.
  *   **Intent**: To convey precision, authority, and a "no-nonsense" product management style.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Asymmetric Split**: Hero section uses a 60/40 split with bold typography on the left and a geometric abstract composition on the right.
  *   **Modular Cards**: Experience and projects are presented in strictly defined, bordered cards that look like technical specs or tickets.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Thick Borders**: Use 2px or 3px borders for cards and sections to define boundaries.
  *   **Monospace Accents**: Use a monospace font for tags, dates, and metrics to give a "data-driven" feel.
  *   **Oversized Typography**: Section headings are massive and bold, acting as graphical elements themselves.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Sharp Hover States**: Buttons and cards have instant, sharp color changes or displacements (no soft fades).
  *   **Sticky Headers**: Section titles stick to the top as you scroll through long content like the experience timeline.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Slide & Reveal**: Elements slide in from the bottom or side with a snappy ease.
  *   **Typewriter Effect**: For the hero pitch or key metrics to simulate data processing.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** or **Syne** (Bold, geometric sans-serif).
  *   **Body**: **Inter** or **DM Sans** (Clean, legible).
  *   **Accents**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** (For technical details).

  **Design Movement**: **Glassmorphism / Ethereal Tech**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Depth & Layering**: Use translucency and blur to create a sense of depth and hierarchy.
  2.  **Soft & Fluid**: Rounded corners, smooth gradients, and organic shapes to make the tech feel human-centric.
  3.  **Light & Air**: Ample whitespace and light backgrounds to create a feeling of openness and possibility.
  4.  **Subtle Sophistication**: Details are whispered, not shouted; focus on micro-interactions and polish.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Indigo (#4f46e5)**: Used in gradients and soft glows, rarely as a solid block, to create a "tech aura."
  *   **Slate/Gray**: Softer, cool grays for text to blend harmoniously with the airy background.
  *   **Intent**: To portray a forward-thinking, innovative, and user-empathetic product leader.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Floating Elements**: Cards and sections feel like they are floating on different planes.
  *   **Central Focus**: Hero section centers the value proposition with a glowing, ethereal background behind it.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Frosted Glass**: Navigation, cards, and overlays use `backdrop-filter: blur()` to pick up background colors.
  *   **Soft Shadows**: Deep, diffuse colored shadows (using the Indigo tint) instead of harsh black shadows.
  *   **Mesh Gradients**: Subtle, moving background gradients that shift slowly.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Parallax**: Background elements move at different speeds than foreground content.
  *   **Magnetic Buttons**: Buttons gently pull towards the cursor.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Fade & Float**: Elements gently fade in and float up.
  *   **Breathing Glows**: Background gradients pulse slowly to make the site feel "alive."

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Modern, geometric but friendly).
  *   **Body**: **Satoshi** or **General Sans** (Clean, modern sans-serif).

  **Design Movement**: **Modern Minimalist / Editorial**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Content First**: The text and case studies are the heroes; design recedes to support them.
  2.  **Typographic Hierarchy**: Use size, weight, and spacing to create structure without heavy lines or boxes.
  3.  **Elegant Simplicity**: Remove non-essential elements; focus on the "signal," reduce the "noise."
  4.  **Professional Polish**: High-end feel, similar to a premium magazine or a top-tier consultancy report.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Indigo (#4f46e5)**: Used sparingly as a "highlighter" for links and very specific calls to action.
  *   **Slate/Gray**: High-contrast black/dark gray for headings, softer gray for body text for comfortable reading.
  *   **Intent**: To communicate clarity, maturity, and strategic thinking.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Single Column Focus**: Main content flows in a focused central column for optimal readability.
  *   **Whitespace Framing**: Generous margins and padding to frame the content elegantly.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Serif Headings**: Use a modern serif for headings to add a touch of authority and elegance.
  *   **Fine Lines**: Very thin (1px) dividers in light gray to separate sections subtly.
  *   **Iconography**: Minimalist, thin-stroke icons (Lucide) that match the refined aesthetic.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Subtle Underlines**: Links have elegant underline animations.
  *   **Smooth Scroll**: Very polished smooth scrolling between sections.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Staggered Fade**: Text lines fade in one by one.
  *   **Image Zoom**: Subtle zoom effect on project images/cards on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Playfair Display** or **Lora** (Modern Serif).
  *   **Body**: **Inter** or **Public Sans** (Highly readable sans-serif).
